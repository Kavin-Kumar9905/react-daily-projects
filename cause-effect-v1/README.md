# Cause & Effect v1

Cause & Effect v1 is a simple web application that demonstrates a common
user interface pattern known as the **master–detail pattern**.

This version is built using **only native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
(without any frameworks or libraries).

## Problem Statement

applications.
